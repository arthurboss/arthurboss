### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Arthur, Javascript/Frontend developer currently living in Berlin and working for [heycar](https://hey.car/).

Fascinated by technology and a long time computer technician, I also have an extensive knowledge on computer hardware and seek to go beyond my limits to combine my passion and experience in hardware and software to help diminishing humanitarian and environmental issues.
