### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Arthur, frontend developer currently living in Berlin and working for [heycar](https://hey.car/).

Fascinated by technology, long time computer technician/enthusiast and currently exploring the web development world. I seek to go beyond my limits to combine my passion for hardware with the learnings of web and software development to diminish humanitarian and environmental issues.
